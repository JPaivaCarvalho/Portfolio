# Mental Health in the Tech Industry

## Project Overview
This project explores mental health attitudes and the prevalence of mental health conditions among employees in the tech industry. 
We will use SQL to analyze and gain insights from survey data.


## Understand the Dataset
The dataset consists of responses from employees in the technology industry to surveys on mental health conducted between 2014 and 2019. It includes three main tables:
- Survey: Contains metadata about each year's survey, including the survey ID and description.
- Question: Stores the text of each question and a unique identifier for each.
- Answer: Contains individual responses, linking users to questions and surveys, and storing their answers in text format.

Some questions have numeric answers (e.g., age), while many others are categorical (e.g., Yes/No, country, gender) or even open-text. This structure allows us to explore both quantitative trends (like averages or counts) and qualitative perceptions (such as comfort discussing mental health).

Understanding the types of questions and how responses are stored is key to designing meaningful queries and extracting insights from the data.

To better organize the analysis, we grouped the survey questions into thematic areas:
- Demographic Information
- Diagnosis, Treatment, and Mental Health Condition
- Employer Support and Benefits
- Communication and Comfort Discussing Mental Health
- Stigma and Perceived Consequences
- Open-Ended Responses and Comments

This thematic categorization helps structure the analysis logically and enables us to generate more relevant and actionable insights around different aspects of mental health in the workplace.


## ðŸ”µDemographic Information
Includes data such as age, gender, role, location, work arrangement, and company size to enable segmentation of responses.

### ðŸ“ŠAge
Data cleaning was performed, considering valid age responses between 18 (the legal minimum working age) and 70 (the typical retirement age, and because only one response was recorded beyond this point).

```sql
SELECT 
  Age,
  COUNT(*) AS Total,
  FORMAT(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 'N1') + '%' AS Percentage
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CAST(a.AnswerText AS INT) AS Age
  FROM dbo.Answer a
  WHERE a.QuestionID = 1
    AND TRY_CAST(a.AnswerText AS INT) BETWEEN 18 AND 70
) AS sub
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Percentage DESC;
```

Average age by survey year                                    
```sql
SELECT 
    a.SurveyID,
    AVG(CAST(a.AnswerText AS FLOAT)) AS AverageAge
FROM dbo.Answer a
WHERE a.QuestionID = 1
  AND TRY_CAST(a.AnswerText AS INT) BETWEEN 18 AND 70
GROUP BY a.SurveyID
ORDER BY a.SurveyID;
```

### ðŸ“ŠGender
The list of responses was grouped into standardized gender categories.

```sql

    END AS Gender_Group
  FROM dbo.Answer a
