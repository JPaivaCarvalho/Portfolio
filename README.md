### SQL, Python, Power BI / [Mental Health in the Tech Industry](https://github.com/JPaivaCarvalho/Portfolio/blob/main/Mental%20Health%20in%20Tech%20Industry/Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Tech%20Industry.md)
- **Description**: In this project, I explored survey data on mental health in the tech industry using SQL.

- **Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Power BI and [Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BJCwakEKMms_kOmQOM0LTZrEnYwSzQ6y?usp=sharing)
- **Key Features**:
  - Cleaned and standardized survey responses across multiple question types (e.g., binary, Likert scale, open text).  
  - Grouped questions by theme to allow structured analysis across areas like employer support, diagnosis history, and employee comfort levels.  
  - Used SQL to calculate percentages, handle missing values, and identify patterns across survey years.
