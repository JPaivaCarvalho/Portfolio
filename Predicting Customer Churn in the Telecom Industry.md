# ðŸ“ŠPredicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry

## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for many businesses, especially in competitive markets like telecommunications. Being able to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using a service enables companies to take proactive steps to retain them. In this beginner-friendly machine learning project, we aim to build a predictive model that identifies potential churners based on customer demographics and service usage patterns. Using the publicly available Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, we will perform data cleaning, 
feature engineering, and train classification models.

## Objective
To predict whether a customer will stop using a service based on their demographic information and service usage patterns.
