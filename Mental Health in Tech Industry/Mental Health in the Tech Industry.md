## Project Overview
This project explores mental health attitudes and the prevalence of mental health conditions among employees in the tech industry. 
We will use SQL to analyze and gain insights from survey data.
To complement the insights extracted through SQL analysis, this project includes an interactive data visualization dashboard built with [Power BI](https://github.com/JPaivaCarvalho/Portfolio/blob/main/Mental%20Health%20in%20Tech%20Industry/Mental%20Health%20in%20Tech%20Industry%20Dashboard.pbix). It allows for a clearer interpretation of trends, patterns, and key findings around mental health in the tech industry.


## Understand the Dataset
The dataset consists of responses from employees in the technology industry to surveys on mental health conducted between 2014 and 2019. It includes three main tables:
- Survey: Contains metadata about each year's survey, including the survey ID and description.
- Question: Stores the text of each question and a unique identifier for each.
- Answer: Contains individual responses, linking users to questions and surveys, and storing their answers in text format.

Some questions have numeric answers (e.g., age), while many others are categorical (e.g., Yes/No, country, gender) or even open-text. This structure allows us to explore both quantitative trends (like averages or counts) and qualitative perceptions (such as comfort discussing mental health).

Understanding the types of questions and how responses are stored is key to designing meaningful queries and extracting insights from the data.

To better organize the analysis, we grouped the survey questions into thematic areas:

- **Demographic Information**
- **Diagnosis, Treatment, and Mental Health Condition**
- **Employer Support and Benefits**
- **Communication and Comfort Discussing Mental Health**
- **Open-Ended Responses and Comments**

This thematic categorization helps structure the analysis logically and enables us to generate more relevant and actionable insights around different aspects of mental health in the workplace.

## üí°Main Insights

- Most respondents are between 25 and 35 years old. The majority work in tech companies or hold technical roles (e.g., back-end developer, DevOps, support). A large portion live and work in the United States.
  
- About one-third of respondents currently have a diagnosed mental health condition. 40‚Äì50% have sought treatment from a mental health professional at some point. Even among those receiving treatment, many report that symptoms still interfere with their work at least ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù. Most commonly mentioned conditions (from open-ended responses):Mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, personality disorders. A significant number don‚Äôt feel comfortable discussing mental health issues with: Direct supervisors, HR departments, Colleagues. Many fear negative career consequences, stigma, or discrimination.
  
- Nearly half of respondents say their employer does not offer clear mental health benefits. Even when benefits exist, many don‚Äôt know how to access them or what‚Äôs included. Most companies have never formally addressed mental health through internal communication or wellness programs. Anonymity in using mental health resources is not guaranteed or not clearly communicated.

- Regarding Previous Employer Practices: Trends are similar to current employers: lack of formal discussion or support. Many open responses describe negative experiences, such as being dismissed or judged for speaking up. However, some positive examples also exist: empathetic leadership, flexibility, and access to paid therapy.

- Respondents shared practical suggestions to improve mental health support: Normalize mental health conversations. Train managers to be more empathetic and better informed. Offer flexible hours and remote work options.
Provide clear access to resources (therapy, leave, support lines). Combat the toxic productivity culture and ‚Äúhustle mindset.‚Äù

Below you can find the results, the SQL queries, and the outputs that lead us to these insights.

## üîµDemographic Information
Includes data such as age, gender, role, location, work arrangement, and company size to enable segmentation of responses.

### üìäAge
Data cleaning was performed, considering valid age responses between 18 (the legal minimum working age) and 70 (the typical retirement age, and because only one response was recorded beyond this point).

```sql
SELECT 
  Age,
  COUNT(*) AS Total,
  FORMAT(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 'N1') + '%' AS Percentage
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CAST(a.AnswerText AS INT) AS Age
  FROM dbo.Answer a
  WHERE a.QuestionID = 1
    AND TRY_CAST(a.AnswerText AS INT) BETWEEN 18 AND 70
) AS sub
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Percentage DESC;
```

ORDER BY a.SurveyID;
```

### üìäGender
The list of responses was grouped into standardized gender categories.

```sql

Employees are asking for a more human, flexible, and mentally healthy work environment. They want companies‚Äîespecially in the tech industry‚Äîto take meaningful steps: open conversations, 
flexible policies, access to care, and above all, a culture that values people over performance.

üß† 1. Normalize Mental Health
- A recurring theme is the call to treat mental health like physical health:
  
  ‚Ä¢ Reduce stigma and encourage openness.
  ‚Ä¢ Include mental health in everyday conversations at work.
  ‚Ä¢ Acknowledge that struggles are part of being human.
  
**‚ÄúAccept that we‚Äôre all actually humans and that‚Äôs OK. Don‚Äôt frame negative behavior as weakness.‚Äù**

üí¨ 2. Open Communication & Empathetic Management

- Respondents emphasized the need for:

  ‚Ä¢ Managers trained to handle mental health topics.
  ‚Ä¢ Safe and supportive spaces to talk without fear of judgment or consequences.
  ‚Ä¢ Clear mental health policies communicated to all.

**‚ÄúAwareness. Start discussing it more. Support. Offer onsite counseling.‚Äù**

üè† 3. Flexible Work Arrangements

- Flexibility emerged as a clear priority:

  ‚Ä¢ Remote work or hybrid models.
  ‚Ä¢ Flexible hours and reduced workload when needed.
  ‚Ä¢ Access to sick leave for mental health issues.

**‚ÄúA work culture that respects personal life is most important: flexible schedules, remote options, asynchronous communication.‚Äù**

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Formal Resources & Accessibility

- Many respondents requested:

  ‚Ä¢ Insurance that covers mental health care.
  ‚Ä¢ Free or subsidized therapy.
  ‚Ä¢ Anonymous ways to seek help (e.g. hotlines or platforms).

**‚ÄúEmployers should offer free access to therapy and create anonymous channels to request help.‚Äù**

üîÅ 5. Toxic Productivity Culture

- A strong critique of overwork and hustle culture came through:

  ‚Ä¢ High performance expectations despite personal challenges.
  ‚Ä¢ Lack of rest culture or burnout prevention measures.
  ‚Ä¢ Misunderstanding of what mental health support truly means.

‚ÄúThe tech industry glorifies overwork. We need to normalize breaks and burnout prevention.‚Äù

‚úèÔ∏è Other Patterns

- Frustration with HR and lack of follow-through.

  ‚Ä¢ Calls for education at all organizational levels.
  ‚Ä¢ Recognition that mental health should be discussed from onboarding to leadership.
