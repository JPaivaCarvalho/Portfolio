# Total Optimization Plan for the Google Merchandise Store

### Introduction
- The objective is to increase online sales and improve the user experience on the website.

- You must analyze, draw conclusions, and present an action plan based on data from the Google Analytics Demo Account.

### Understand Dataset
ðŸ”µ Date Range: From January 1st until today. **Why?**
  - Recent data â†’ I get an up-to-date view of user behavior.
  - Sufficient volume â†’ There is enough traffic and conversions for the analysis to be statistically meaningful.
  - Campaigns and seasonality â†’ I can detect the impact of special periods (e.g., Christmas, sales, etc.).
  - Avoid outdated data â†’ Websites and campaigns change over time, so data from a year ago may no longer reflect the current reality.

ðŸ”µ Unsampled report
  - This means the report is based on 100% of the available data.
  - In other words, no sampling was applied â€” viewing all real data, without estimates.

ðŸ”µ Thresholding applied
  - Google applied thresholding to protect user privacy.
  - This means that some data may be hidden (for example, if the number of users is very small and individuals could potentially be identified).
  - I will only see data in the report elements that meet the minimum data volume requirements.

ðŸ”µ Data source
  - Indicates that the report is using both intraday and daily data.
  - "Intraday" means it also shows data from the current day, even if the dayâ€™s data is not yet complete.

### 1. Audience Analysis

The two age groups generating the highest revenue are:
25-34 years old, with a total revenue of $105,938.41.
35-44 years old, with a total revenue of $64,671.15.

**- Gender: which one has the higher conversion rate?**

Male users contributed to 35.21% of the total revenue, slightly outperforming female users who contributed 33.14%.

ðŸ”µ **Location**

**- Which are the five countries with the most revenue?**

The U.S. market is by far the most important, generating over 90% of the total revenue.
All other countries combined account for only about 7â€“8% of the total revenue.

There are countries with high traffic but very low conversion rates and revenue. In particular, India, Philippines, and South Korea have a 
relatively high number of users but contribute minimally to total revenue. This suggests that while these markets attract traffic, they do 
not convert effectively, which could be due to factors such as purchasing power, language barriers, or product-market fit.

ðŸ”µ **Devices**

**- Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet: where is the conversion rate better? And the average revenue?**

Conversion rate (Key events: purchase): the conversion is represented in the 'Key events â€“ purchase' column. 
The best conversion rate (in terms of purchase volume) comes from Desktop, with more than 90% of the conversions.
